:page_with_curl: Our paper "Fluctuation-driven dynamics in nanoscale thin-film flows: Physical insights from numerical investigations" is now avaliable in Physical Review Fluids! :clap: In this paper we employed an adaptive grid finite difference scheme to solve the stochastic lubrication equations. We then looked into (i) droplet spreading, (ii) droplet coalescence, and (iii) thin-film rupture, where we are able to probe the final stage of rupture with reasonable computational cost thanks to the adaptive scheme.
