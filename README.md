# JingbangLiu.github.io
Jingbang Liu's personal website

Apparently I broke my python, so I need to start a virtual environment
```
source ~/my_new_pythonenv/bin/activate
```
To use jekyll, go to the home directory of your webiste and type:
```
bundle exec jekyll serve --lsi
```
then the website should be hosted at 
```
https://localhost:4000/
```
