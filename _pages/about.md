Welcom to my homepage!

I am now a postdoct at the Department of Mathematics, University of Oslo, within the group of [Prof. Andreas Carlson](https://acarlson-uio.github.io/index.html). I will be working on bio-physics related problems, in particular modelling of cell membrane folding. My postdoc is also part of the [AUTORHYTHM](https://www.uio.no/english/research/strategic-research-areas/life-science/research/convergence-environments/autorhythm/) project.

I did my PhD at the Mathematics Institute, University of Warwick, under the supervision of [Prof. James Sprittles](https://jamessprittles.com) and [Prof. Duncan Lockerby](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/eng/people/duncan_lockerby/). We were mainly interested fluids at nanoscale, where inter-atomic forces and thermal fluctuations are no longer negligible. We mainly used fluctuating hydrodynamics for modeling, and numerical simulations (either solving the fluctuating hydrodynamics numerically, or use molecular dynamics) for validation. In particular I was looking into the effects of solids side walls to the fluctuation amplitude and the spontaneous rupture of nanoscale thin liquid films. My PhD was funded by the [EPSRC CDT in Modelling of Heterogeneous Systems](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/hetsys/).

I did my MSc at the Mathematical Institute, University of Oxford in Mathematical Modelling and 
Scientific Computing and graduated with a merit. My dissertation was supervised by [Prof. Irene Moroz](https://www.maths.ox.ac.uk/people/irene.moroz) and [Dr. Hannah Christensen](https://www.physics.ox.ac.uk/our-people/arnold). We studied the dynamical properties of El Ni√±o Southern Oscillation (ENSO) using the 
Vallis 1986 model and explored the possible impacts of Greenhouse Warming on ENSO.

I did my BSc in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics at both Shandong University (PRC) and University of Manchester (UK) in a 2+2 program.
