:page_with_curl: Our open access paper ["Mean first passage times and Eyring–Kramers formula for fluctuating hydrodynamics
"](https://doi.org/10.1088/1742-5468/ad8075)[(pdf)](../assets/pdf/Liu_2024_J._Stat._Mech._2024_103206.pdf) is now avaliable in Journal of Statistical Mechanics: Theory and Experiment! :laughing: In this paper we formally derived the new Eyring–Kramers law for gradient flow with conserved quantities which was used in the previous papaer to explain the rare rupture of nano thin films. We also showed in details how to numerically evaluate the newly predicted mean first passage time with a few examples. We hope this work will make it easier to apply the Eyring–Kramers law in other fields of science, where randomness at small scales can have a significant impact at larger scales.
