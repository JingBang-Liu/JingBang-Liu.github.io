:page_with_curl: Our open access letter "Rogue Nanowaves: A Route to Film Rupture" is now avaliable in Physical Review Fluids! :laughing: In this letter we used the rare event theory to explain why linearly stable thin liquid films would rupture at nanoscale. The theoretical prediction of the average rupture time agrees very well with numerical simulations (both solving fluctuating hydrodynamics numerically and molecular dynamics simulations) results. This theoretical framework shows great potential that can be adapted to other problems as well.
