:page_with_curl: Our open access paper ["Thermal capillary waves on bounded nanoscale thin films"](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevE.107.015105) is now avaliable in Physical Review E! :laughing: In this paper we investigated the effects of solid walls on the fluctuation amplitudes of the free surface of nanoscale thin liquid films. Analytical expression were derived for both 2D and 3D films, and molecular dynamics simulations were performed to validate the theory.
